## 🌟 Final Reflection

CS50x was more than just a computer science course—it was a complete transformation of how I approach problems, think about technology, and view my own capabilities. Starting as someone who had never written a line of code, I emerged with the confidence and skills to build meaningful software that solves real problems.

The course's emphasis on "correctness, design, and style" became a personal philosophy that extends beyond programming. Every challenging problem set, every late-night debugging session, and every moment of breakthrough contributed to developing not just technical skills, but resilience, creativity, and a growth mindset.

**Most Valuable Lesson:** "The best way to learn programming is to program." CS50x doesn't just teach syntax—it teaches you to think like a computer scientist.


## 📄 Academic Integrity & Sharing Policy

This repository documents my independent journey through Harvard's CS50x, completed in full accordance with the course's academic honesty policy. All solutions and projects were developed solely by me, without collaboration or reference to others' work. To respect both the integrity of the learning process and CS50's guidelines, problem set solutions remain private and are not shared publicly.

If you're seeking guidance or mentorship, I'm happy to offer advice and support—just reach out! However, I encourage all learners to tackle assignments on their own for genuine growth.

**Note:**  
Due to CS50's academic honesty policy, I cannot publicly share course assignments or solution code. Once my certificate is available, I'll update this page with a direct link. Meanwhile, you can view proof of completion on my LinkedIn profile.
