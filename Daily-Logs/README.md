## 💡 Best Practices

### Writing Effective Logs

1. **Be Consistent**
   - Log every day, even if brief
   - Use the same format
   - Log at the same time (end of day works best)

2. **Be Honest**
   - Document failures and successes
   - Note frustrations and breakthroughs
   - Track actual time spent

3. **Be Specific**
   - Name exact problems and concepts
   - Include problem numbers/links
   - Note specific errors made

4. **Be Reflective**
   - Ask "why" questions
   - Connect current to past learning
   - Plan based on insights

5. **Be Brief but Complete**
   - Capture essentials without over-writing
   - Use bullet points
   - Focus on actionable insights

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Logging only successes
- ❌ Being too vague ("solved some problems")
- ❌ Copying problem descriptions verbatim
- ❌ Skipping days (breaks the habit)
- ❌ Not reviewing past logs
