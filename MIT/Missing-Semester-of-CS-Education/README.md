## 🎯 Course Description

The Missing Semester addresses the critical gap in computer science education by focusing on the practical tools and skills that students use daily but are rarely taught formally. Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there's one critical subject that's rarely covered: proficiency with their tools.

### Philosophy
Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. This course transforms you from a tool user to a tool master.
